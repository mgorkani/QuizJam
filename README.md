# QuizJam

QuizJam is an app built with SwiftUI 2.0 to aid with memorization. QuizJam mimics the IRL flashcard study experience we're familiar with, with a popular "Tinder-style" twist.

## Key Features

- You can create, edit, and delete flashcards
- Review your flashcard bank
- Save created flashcards for the next time you open the app
- Enter practice mode, where cards are randomized and displayed in a carousel. You can run through the set and perform gestures: tapping on the flashcard flips the card to reveal the answer, while swiping left means you guessed correctly and swiping right, incorrectly.
- When your practice session is over, you can view results, and plan accordingly to improve.
