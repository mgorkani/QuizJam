# QuizJam

QuizJam is an app built with SwiftUI 2.0 to aid with memorization. QuizJam mimics the IRL flashcard study experience we're familiar with, with a popular "Tinder-style" twist.

## Key Features
- You can create, edit, and delete flashcards
- Review your flashcard bank
- Save created flashcards for the next time you open the app
- Enter practice mode, where cards are randomized and displayed in a carousel. You can run through the set and perform gestures: tapping on the flashcard flips the card to reveal the answer, while swiping left means you guessed correctly and swiping right, incorrectly. You can view your progress as you make your way through the set.
- When your practice session is over, you can try again, and plan accordingly to improve.

_Note: Optimized for iPhone models with screens larger >= iPhone SE._
